## Problem statement:
Design and develop an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides the Call Center Manager with a comprehensive view of key performance metrics (KPIs) . This dashboard will enable the manager to efficiently monitor, analyze, and improve call center performance by visualizing critical metrics such as call volume, average handle time (AHT), service level, agent performance, customer satisfaction, and other relevant KPIs.

## Data source:
The dataset was provided as an excel file by PwC s part of  PwC Power BI in Data Analytics Virtual Case Experience

## Data Preparation & Modeling:
Completed the Data transformation in Power Query and the dataset loaded into Microsoft Power BI Desktop for modelling.
Data Cleaning for the dataset was done in the power query editor as follows:
- Removed Unnecessary columns
- Removed Unnecessary rows
- Each of the columns in the table were validated to have the correct data type

## Insights

1.	The daily average number of calls at the call center is 56. 
2.	An 81% call answer rate, consistent across all agents, indicates a relatively stable level of responsiveness within the call center. Consistency across agents implies that the processes or training related to answering calls are generally standardized, but it could also highlight the need for further optimization to improve performance overall.	
3.	A 73% case resolution rate, with 27% of cases remaining unresolved, indicates that the call center is successfully addressing most customer issues but still faces challenges in fully resolving a portion of them. The unresolved cases may point to areas for improvement, such as the need for more specialized training, better access to resources, or improved escalation processes to handle complex issues. 
4.	The fact that 23% of satisfaction ratings are a 3 and 24% are a 4 suggests that the majority of customers rate their experience as "neutral" to "satisfied." While these ratings aren't necessarily poor, they indicate that customers feel their experiences are average or somewhat positive, but there's room for improvement in providing exceptional service. 
5.	The resolution rate trends over the past three months show fluctuations in performance:
   - January (74%): The highest resolution rate, indicating strong performance in resolving customer issues during this period.
   - February (71%): A slight dip in the resolution rate, suggesting potential challenges or changes in processes, staffing, or customer complexity during that month.
   - March (72.8%): A recovery and slight increase, indicating improvements or adjustments made to enhance issue resolution, although it still remains just below January's peak.
6.	Average handle time is 67.5

## Recommendation:
- 	The majority of calls are being answered, there may still be room for improvement in reducing wait times or increasing the answer rate, especially during high-volume periods.
- Identifying the root causes of unresolved cases can help the call center develop targeted strategies to enhance issue resolution, ensure agents have the necessary tools and knowledge, and improve overall service quality
- The call center could enhance the customer experience, such as reducing call handling time, improving agent communication skills, or resolving issues more effectively to drive higher satisfaction scores.
